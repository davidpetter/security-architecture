# Security architecture
A compiled list of information regarding security principles and solutions

## Application security principles
* Apply defense in depth
* Use a positive security model (fail-safe defaults, minimize attack surface)
* Fail securely
* Run with least privilege
* Avoid security by obscurity (open design)
* Keep security simple (verifiable, economy of mechanism)
* Detect intrusions (compromise recording)
* Don’t trust infrastructure
* Don’t trust services
* Establish secure defaults (psychological acceptability)
